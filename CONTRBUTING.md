### Installation

   - [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable)
2. Fork this repo to your account and clone the forked repo to your local machine
3. Open the project directory in terminal of your choice.
4. Run the `install` script to launch the server:

```bash
yarn install
```
5. Finally, open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

> The Project is built with [Create-React-App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). \
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Available Scripts

#### `yarn test`
```bash
yarn test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`
```bash
yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `yarn eject`
```bash
yarn eject
```
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
